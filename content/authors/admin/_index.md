I specialize in robot learning, developing diffusion-based policies, VLM-driven controllers, and reinforcement learning agents
for embodied tasks. I have experience working with physical robotic hardware as well as simulation platforms for large-scale
data generation. I focus on building robust training pipelines and model architectures that translate to robotic systems.
